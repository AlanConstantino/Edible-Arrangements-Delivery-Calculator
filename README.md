# Edible-Arrangements-Delivery-Calculator
I made this calculator to help me get the total amount of money earned by making Edible Arrangements deliveries.

## Things to add:
- For the love of god please make the code cleaner and easier to read.
  - Maybe look into using Webpack and Babel again to modularize code
- Add an error message/popup that tells you which zip code was invalid
- Convert 'zipCodeValues' into a json file that you can just read so adding more zip codes down the line won't be a pain.

## Bugs
- [x] When viewing on an actual mobile device, the total window doesn't display properly.
  - To view on mobile use the following url https://MY_LOCAL_IP:PORT_NUMBER
- [ ] Having multiple new lines '\n' within textarea will break the program. The sum will be "NaN"
- [x] The buttons don't display properly, they get cutoff.
- [x] The total window's button, 'Restart' gets cut off
  - [ ] When you scroll while the total window is open, you don't scroll down on the total window but the whole window.
